# Fhaschard-o-matic

The final project for the Chegg Skills Frontend Web Development course. 

### TODO

1. Find out why some components are rendering up to 3 times. 
2. With `DeckPage.jsx` and `DeckStudyPage.jsx`, the state variables are `null` until the `useEffect` runs. 
3. Run tests.
4. Get the `<NotFound />` component to work properly.
